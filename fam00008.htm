Mordechai, the second son of Joseph Aharon, also moved to Chust and married his wife Dvora (&quot;Dora&quot;). They were a young couple and a baby boy was born, Abraham, in 1942. The young family were taken to Auschwitz and separated there. We believe that the mother and the baby were sent to Mouthouzen. Mordechai survived the camp and returned home to find out that his wife and son were killed. Mordechai went back to Komarno, there he met Dvora (Arenka) and married her. Together with his youngest brothers, Zvi (Miklosh) and Yechezkel (Haskel) they decided to make an Aliya for Israel, and boarded a ship, Theodor Herzl. The trip was very very long. Instead of going east to Palestine, the ship was sent to Belgium were they had to wait for 6 month for permission. In Belgium, Mordechai and Dvora delivered their 1st son Joseph (Yossi) in January 1946. When they got the permit to sail, the British captured the ship and they were sent to Cyprus. They were kept there for about 6 month but since they had a baby, they got a certification earlier than the rest of the family and settled in Bnei-Brak. Israel. Mordechai was a shoemaker, a profession he studied back home. For all his life in Israel, he work for Army in his profession. Mordechai passed away in 1974 after suffering from heart diseases, and diabetes (Sakeret).</td>

Haskel Aharon, the 3rd son of Joseph Aharon, grew up in Komarno. Around 1935, he moved to Budapest and studied to become a tailor. He met Ilus-Rivka (Eilona) Davidovic and married her in 1942. Life in Budapest during the war were very difficult for Jews. Many of them where sent to labor camps and did not survived while others were killed from air bombs. The others were sent to Auschwitz just before the end of the war as a special effort of Adolf Aichman. Eilona was sent as well to Auschwitz while Haskel was on the run and found a shelter in a deserted house in Budapest. Miraculously, Eilona survived and returned back to Budapest to reunion with Haskel. After a while they decided to join the other Aharon brothers, Mordechai and Milklosh,&nbsp; and they had boarded as well to the same ship, Theodore Herzl, on their way to Palestine (Israel). <br>Longer trip than expected, they had to stop 6 month in Belgium (where their daughter Rachel were born) and then 21 (!) month were kept in Cyprus by the British, and finally arrived to Israel only after Israel got it independence in January 1949. <br>Haskel worked as a tailor here, second son , Ben-Zion (Bennie) was born in 1955 but in 1959 they decided to try their luck in Australia and moved to Melbourne.<br>Haskel changed his official his private name to Henrik. Like his brother in Israel, he changed his name to Aharoni but write is as Aroni. <br></td>

Zvi (Miklosh) was born in Komarno and studied at the local Czech gymnasium. In 1935 he moved to Brno in Czechoslovakia to study to become a tailor and stayed there until 1940. By that time, Komarno went back to the control of the Hungarians and Miklosh was drafted to the Hungarian Army. He was released but drafted again until 1944. By the time he was released, the Nazis started to send Jews to labor camps and then to Auschwitz. Miklosh was deported to Germany (Urenberg) to a labor camp where he worked for Siemens.&nbsp; He survived and returned to Komarno.<br>The Czechs deported the Germans from the Sudets and offered to their people lands, shops and housing in order to move and settle there. Miklosh got a shop in one of the Sudets towns and moved. Meanwhile he felt that the Communism is about to take control and decided to leave to Israel. Together with Mordechai, his elder brother who stayed in Komarno, his 2nd Brother, Haskel and their families they took the 1st chance and boarded the ship Theodore Herzl on the way to Palestine (Israel).<br>A trip of 2.5 weeks turned to a 2.5 years!!! As they did not have certification, they were forced to enter a European port and the Captain took the ship to Antwerp Belgium. They were waiting there for 6 month until the organizer took a decision to sail to Palestine. But near the territorial border of Palestine, a British armada was waiting for the Theodore Herzl and drags them to Cyprus. The passengers where again putted in a camp and stayed there 21 months!!!&nbsp; By that time, Israel was already a sovereign state and they landed in Haifa (Israel) in January 1949.<br>In Israel, Miklosh met Miriam Mermelstein from Munkach and married her. Lived in Ramat-Gan, started as a tailor, but soon changed his occupation and worked as a conductor in the Train Authority until his retirement.<br>Today, Miklosh and Miriam live in Hod-Hasharon, Israel.&nbsp; <br></td>
