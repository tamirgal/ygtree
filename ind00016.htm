      <p>Comments: Shimshon Farkas, born&nbsp; in Tjacev (Tecso) (Tacovo). He lived in this small village, with his family and some 1500 Jews. . <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the origin, the village was under the Austro-Hungarian government, …in 1920, it passed to the new Czechoslovakian state. After some years, it was shifted back to Hungary, untill&nbsp; World War 2.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As many Jewish villages in the area, it was victim of the Nazi persecution, and their &quot;Final solution&quot;. Jews were gathered in central ghetto in the village.&nbsp; Some were sent to Nazi labor camps, while others were deported to Auschwitz and other extermination camps, between the years 1942-1944.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was also the destiny of the Farkash family, … Some members died in that holocaust, some escaped, some&nbsp; survived, in spite their capture and detention in those camps, … .<br>Shimshon was very young,&nbsp; (aged 5 years) , and could not resist the atrocities, and sufferings.<br>He died in that Holaucost, with 6 million European Jews.</p>
