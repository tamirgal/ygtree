Yehuda Wolf Farkas, known as Farkas Farkas, born&nbsp; in Mervesive Near Tyachev (Tacovo). His Mother died when he was a child and was sent to Tyachev to be shoemaker apprentice of David Aharon. At age 18 he was married to David&#39;s daughter, Frida. <br> At the origin, the village was under the Austro-Hungarian government untill the end of WW1 and then became part of&nbsp; the new Czechoslovakian state. After some years, it was shifted back to Hungary, untill&nbsp; World War 2. As many Jewish villages in the area, it was victim of the Nazi persecution, and their &quot;Final solution&quot;.&nbsp; Jews were gathered in central ghetto in the village.&nbsp; Some were sent to Nazi labor camps, while others were deported to Auschwitz and other extermination camps, between the years 1942-1944.<br>That was also the destiny of the Farkash family, Some members died in that holocaust, some escaped, some&nbsp; survived, in spite their capture and detention in those camps, … <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yehuda, his wife Frida and their 2 younget sons, Kalman and Shimshon did not survive, and&nbsp; died in the Holaucost., but the 4 daughters survived.<br><br>Personal comments : <br>Yehuda&#39;s nick name in Hungarian was Farkash, which means &quot;wolf&quot;. So he was known as &quot; Farkash&nbsp; Farkash&quot; ,&nbsp; meaning &quot;Wolf Farkash&quot;.<br>When he was a young boy,and after his father&#39;s death, he was sent to&nbsp; David Aharon as a trainee to become a shoemaker. He lived with the Aharon family, met Frida, ... fell in love, and asked&nbsp; his master David, to marry her, although she was older than him.<br>At the beginning of his carreer,he was a shoemaker,... and&nbsp; so , another nickname was attached to him. &quot;Farkash Shouster&quot;, meaning Farkash the shoemaker.<br>This nickname remained,&nbsp; in spite that afterwards he changed his profession, and became a leather trader.</td>
