Born in Cairo, Egypt in 1951 to Elie Patan and Mary Abada Patan.<br>Her name at birth was Victoria, after her grandmother, Victoria Sasson. <br>The new regime in Egypt decided to nationalize the Suetz Channal which was against the interest of Great Britain and France and led to the Synai war in November 1956 (Israel, GB and France conquered Synai desert and the Channal). Right after that, most of the Jews in the country have been asked to leave Egypt immediately. This could happened only because despite the fact that the Jews lived there for generations, they did not possess an Egyption citizenship. Moreover, they were not allowed to immigrate to Israel<br>The Patans left Egypt to Greece, stayed there for couple of months and only then, made Aliyah (immigration to Israel in Hebrew).&nbsp; <br>In Israel, Mary Patan decided to change her daughter&#39;s name to a local one and Victoria became Aviva. Yet, her nick name is still today, Vickey.<br>Aviva grew up in Ramat-Gan, Israel, studied at the Technion, Haifa, Mathematics and Computers and hold today a position of the IT Manager at Unilever, Israel. <br>To learn more about Aviva&#39;s heritage, please visit her father&#39;s homepage at : http://www.sasson.netfirms.com/&nbsp; </td>
