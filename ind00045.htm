      <p>Comments: Mordechai, the second son of Joseph Aharon, also moved to Chust and married his wife Dvora (&quot;Dora&quot;). They were a young couple and a baby boy was born, Abraham, in 1942. The young family were taken to Auschwitz and separated there. We believe that the mother and the baby were sent to Mouthouzen. Mordechai survived the camp and returned home to find out that his wife and son were killed. Mordechai went back to Komarno, there he met Dvora (Arenka) and married her. Together with his youngest brothers, Zvi (Miklosh) and Yechezkel (Haskel) they decided to make an Aliya for Israel, and boarded a ship, Theodor Herzl. The trip was very very long. Instead of going east to Palestine, the ship was sent to Belgium were they had to wait for 6 month for permission. In Belgium, Mordechai and Dvora delivered their 1st son Joseph (Yossi) in January 1946. When they got the permit to sail, the British captured the ship and they were sent to Cyprus. They were kept there for about 6 month but since they had a baby, they got a certification earlier than the rest of the family and settled in Bnei-Brak. Israel. Mordechai was a shoemaker, a profession he studied back home. For all his life in Israel, he work for Army in his profession. Mordechai passed away in 1974 after suffering from heart diseases, and diabetes (Sakeret).</p>
