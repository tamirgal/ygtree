Born: 22-Sep-1931<br>


      
      
      
      <p>Comments: Lilly was the fifth and youngest child of her family in Tjachev. Her Father, Shabety Aharon, was a respected person in his community and for some time had a seat in the Jewish Council of the town. He was an apple-merchant.<br>When Lilly was at age of 4.5 in 1936, a Typhus plague hit the town. Both parents as well as 2 children (Moti and Libchu) were severely ill. The 2 kids survived but unfortunately both parents passed away within 10 days around March 1936. By that time, Victor, the elder brother, already left to Palestine so the 4 kids had to survive on their own. Libchu (age 18) took responsibility on the household while Laybe (age 16.5 only) tried hard to continue his father&#39;s business.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Meanwhile, the children where trying to get certificates to go to Palestine. After 4 years they got one for Libchu, but she refused to leave Lilly behind. They have decided to snick the small girl into the ship where she hided most of the trip to Turkey and then to the Palestine coast. The British police detained the new immigrants and put them in a prison camp near Atlit.<br>At last, they were free, but Lilly, at age of 8, an orphan in a new country, is going to have tough life.<br>Lucky enough she was accepted by the &quot;Alyat-Hanoar&quot; organization which took care of such cases. (Lucky, because they could not accommodate all the cases….). In the next 10 years, Lilly will spend her time in boarding schools: 3 year in Pardes-Hannah (Mossad Alyat-Hanoar), 4 years in Kiriat Bialik (Mossad Ahavah) and another 3.5 years in Nachkat-Izhak (Mossad Wizo). Good temper and positive attitude made it easier for her. During holidays and vacations, she spent times with her brother Victor and Sister Libchu, who both lived in Haifa. While Lilly straggled in Palestine-Israel, her two brothers, Laybe and Moti, stayed behind in Eastern-Europe and had to face the horror of WWII, so we could say that Lilly was lucky really to escape in time.<br>In mid 1950, after the establishment of State of Israel, Lilly was drafted to the young army as all others boys and girls there. She served as an administrator of a Colonel and based near Afula, north of Israel.<br>Lilly was released in March 1952, moved to live in Haifa with her relatives there and soon met Zussia Steiner whom she married in December 1952.<br>For the first 2 years the young couple lived with Zussia parents and then moved to their own flat at Nave-Shaanan - Haifa. <br>Lilly is a widow since 1995, when Zussia died after a long illness, still lives in Nave-Shaanan, raising her 2 daughters and 3 grandchildren.<br></p>
