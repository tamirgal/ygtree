Joseph Goldstein, born in Ungvar/Uzhgorod. He married Antonia Klein and started to work with her father, Avraham-Izhak Klein in the City Toll business he had. <br>When Avraham-Izhak passed away in 1936, he continued the business. He moved the family to be close to the business at Jankovska Ulitsa. <br>The Hungarian took over again in 1938 and in 1939, as part of other new &quot;laws&quot; against the jews, his business was confiscated. <br>In May 1944, he was sent to the Brick factory with his family where all the town jews were assembled, later on were sent to Auschwitz and did not survive.</td>
