      <p>Comments: Zvi (Miklosh) was born in Komarno and studied at the local Czech gymnasium. In 1935 he moved to Brno in Czechoslovakia to study to become a tailor and stayed there until 1940. By that time, Komarno went back to the control of the Hungarians and Miklosh was drafted to the Hungarian Army. He was released but drafted again until 1944. By the time he was released, the Nazis started to send Jews to labor camps and then to Auschwitz. Miklosh was deported to Germany (Urenberg) to a labor camp where he worked for Siemens.&nbsp; He survived and returned to Komarno.<br>The Czechs deported the Germans from the Sudets and offered to their people lands, shops and housing in order to move and settle there. Miklosh got a shop in one of the Sudets towns and moved. Meanwhile he felt that the Communism is about to take control and decided to leave to Israel. Together with Mordechai, his elder brother who stayed in Komarno, his 2nd Brother, Haskel and their families they took the 1st chance and boarded the ship Theodore Herzl on the way to Palestine (Israel).<br>A trip of 2.5 weeks turned to a 2.5 years!!! As they did not have certification, they were forced to enter a European port and the Captain took the ship to Antwerp Belgium. They were waiting there for 6 month until the organizer took a decision to sail to Palestine. But near the territorial border of Palestine, a British armada was waiting for the Theodore Herzl and drags them to Cyprus. The passengers where again putted in a camp and stayed there 21 months!!!&nbsp; By that time, Israel was already a sovereign state and they landed in Haifa (Israel) in January 1949.<br>In Israel, Miklosh met Miriam Mermelstein from Munkach and married her. Lived in Ramat-Gan, started as a tailor, but soon changed his occupation and worked as a conductor in the Train Authority until his retirement.<br>Today, Miklosh and Miriam live in Hod-Hasharon, Israel.&nbsp; <br></p>
