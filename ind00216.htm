      <p>Comments: Haskel Aharon, the 3rd son of Joseph Aharon, grew up in Komarno. Around 1935, he moved to Budapest and studied to become a tailor. He met Ilus-Rivka (Eilona) Davidovic and married her in 1942. Life in Budapest during the war were very difficult for Jews. Many of them where sent to labor camps and did not survived while others were killed from air bombs. The others were sent to Auschwitz just before the end of the war as a special effort of Adolf Aichman. Eilona was sent as well to Auschwitz while Haskel was on the run and found a shelter in a deserted house in Budapest. Miraculously, Eilona survived and returned back to Budapest to reunion with Haskel. After a while they decided to join the other Aharon brothers, Mordechai and Milklosh,&nbsp; and they had boarded as well to the same ship, Theodore Herzl, on their way to Palestine (Israel). <br>Longer trip than expected, they had to stop 6 month in Belgium (where their daughter Rachel were born) and then 21 (!) month were kept in Cyprus by the British, and finally arrived to Israel only after Israel got it independence in January 1949. <br>Haskel worked as a tailor here, second son , Ben-Zion (Bennie) was born in 1955 but in 1959 they decided to try their luck in Australia and moved to Melbourne.<br>Haskel changed his official his private name to Henrik. Like his brother in Israel, he changed his name to Aharoni but write is as Aroni. <br></p>
