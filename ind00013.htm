      <p>Comments: Moshe&nbsp; Goldstein, also known as Mikey, born in Uzhgorod, in Sobranicka St.<br>He studied in the Jewish elementary school for 4 years which was managed by School Master Mr. Horovic and the teacher Mr. Scheinbrum.<br>He started to study in the Czech Gimnasium for 1 year but then was sent to study in the Ukrainian school for 2 years. Then he moved again and changed to the Hebrew Gimnasium where his brothers were studying as well. <br>During high school, Mikey joined the Kadima and Boys-Scouts movement where his Uncle Lotzi was an activist. It also worth mentioning that during that time, Uzhgorod changed rulers, from the Czechs to the Hungarians again and WWII had started. <br>When he graduated, Mikey started to work with a local dentist technician, called Kiraj as a trainee. The clinic was in the city center, near the small market. <br> In April 1944 the Natizs assembled all the jews in the Brick factory and soon they were sent to the extermination camp in Auschwitz.<br>He survived, and freed during the liberation in June 1945.<br> He returned,&nbsp; together with his youngest brother Buyu, to his village, but found no survivals. He jointed &quot;Hashomer Hatzayeer&quot;,and was sent to Italy, to prepare his &quot;Alyah&quot; to Palestine. <br>There he met, Chaya Farkas, whom he married&nbsp; in 1946 and&nbsp; boarded together on the ship &quot;Bracha Fold&quot;, en route to Israel.<br>Near the coast of Israel, the ship was captured by the British navy troops and&nbsp; all passengers&nbsp; were deported to Cyprus. They were detained&nbsp; for 9 months before their release and arrived in Israel in September 1947. In Israel, they were kept again in a camp at Atlit for few months.<br>As a group , they were sent to kibbutz &quot;Messilot&quot;, in the Beit-Shean valley.<br>After a short while, they left to Haifa, where&nbsp; Moshe started to work&nbsp; in building construction until he was drafted to the young IDF (Israel defense force), to participate in the Israeli independence war. <br>He was released&nbsp; in early 1950,and started to work as a telecom technician, in the Israeli&nbsp; PTT,&nbsp; in Haifa where he worked for more&nbsp; than 40 years.<br>Mikey retired in 1979 and enjoys&nbsp; playing Bridge and to raise his 6 grand-children.</p>
