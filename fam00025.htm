<br>
Ondrej (Andy) Clyne was born in Uzhgorod to Moshe-Israel and Paula Klein in 1915. <br>At that time the town was part of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy and called Ungvar.<br>Andy was the eldest son of the family and went to the local Hungarian primary school for 4 years. By that time (after WWI), the town with the rest of the Carpaterus area became part of Czechoslovakia and most of the Jews felt more close to the Czechs because of their reforms. Like many of the other kids, he continued his studies in the Czech Gymnasium for the next 8 years. <br>Soon after his graduation, Andy decided to leave Uzhgorod to study in Prague and has was accepted as a student in the National Czech University, at the Chemistry faculty.<br>During his studies, the Nazi party took control of Germany. The Germans were openly claiming control of other parts in Europe and the sounds of war were in the air. <br>A few months after his graduation, in May 1939, young Andy and couple of his friends decided to leave Prague and to try to go to London. The journey through Czechoslovakia, Germany, Holland and UK took them about 4 weeks and was not without troubles. <br>The Czech Embassy, who helped Czech citizens, sent him to a refugee camp near London, where he was studying English. Soon after, Andy was sent to the local college to assist in Chemistry as a lecturer. As it was the time of WWII, he was also asked to work in the Ministry of War. Andy stayed in the camp for about a year and left about mid 1940.<br>While he was working at the college, Andy met Ellen Cooper and they got married in 1943.<br>Until that time, Andy kept in contact with his family in Uzhgorod via mail but since about 1943 he did not receive mails any more and lost contact with his family.<br>WWII ended and in the summer of 1945, and with his connections at the Ministry, Andy was allowed to travel to Prague to look for his family. <br>Soon he found out that his parents and his kid brother, Gabi, were sent to Auschwitz and did not survive. He also found out that his brother Bella was part of the Hungarian Workers Battalion and had been sent to Siberia by the Russians. (Bella was later released and returned to Uzhgorod). Edith, his sister, was in a labor camp in Germany and returned to Prague but Andy didn&#39;t meet her on his 1st trip. Later on she moved back to Germany, stayed in a refugee camp, and decided, together with her new husband Samuel Kaminski, to move to the USA.<br>After the war, Andy developed his career as a chemical engineer and specialized in planning oil refineries and chemical plants. <br>Ellen and Andy built a nice home at St. Albans, with their 3 children: Paula, Charles and Rachel.<br>Andy soon became a Director and as part of his job had to travel quite extensively throughout the globe, including to what was then called the USSR. This gave Andy the ability to try and visit Uzhgorod (which was part of Ukraine and USSR) and his brother Bella: 2 visits took place, the first with all his family in 1964, and the second one on his own, in 1969.<br>Andy retired in 1987, at the age of 72.<br>Andy lives today in Ringwood near Bournemouth, England, close to his daughter Rachel.<br></td>

<br>
Born in Ungvar (Racotsi st.) in 1918 and studied in the local Hungarian primary school (4 years). He then continued for another 4 years in a Czech school and became a trainee in Drags and pharmaceutical business. <br>WWII started and the Hungarian took over again, after good years with the Czechs who were rulling the territory since the end of WWI.<br>Although the Hungarian were co-operating with the Nazi Germans, they did not send the jews to concetration camps. Instead, they have created what called &quot;The Workers Battalion&quot; and jews had a special regiment there. They were sent to the east front under terrible conditions and many of them did not durvive and died, either by the cold and hunger, or by the Russion bombs.<br>In early 1944, Bella was &quot;recruited&quot; to this battalion and was sent to the Russion front. Together with others, they have decided to run away and to join the Russions against Germany and Hungary, but the Russions were suspicious and decided to send them all to a golag in Siberia. <br>Bella was released at the end of 1945 and returned back home to Uzhgorod. <br>By that time, Uzhgorod was part of Ukraine/USSR and there was no way out to join his Brother Andy (England) or his Sister Edith (USA). <br>In 1970, Bella got his visa and took his family to NYC. His Son Gaby, wanted to go to Israel and he did so after one year in the US and few years later, in 1975, Bella and his wife Agi joined their children in Israel and lived in Naharia.<br>Bella died in 1981.<br></td>
