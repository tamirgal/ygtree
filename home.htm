<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Shalom and welcome to our Family 
website.</span></font></u></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Background</font></b></u></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">My name is Joseph Goldstein <b>Gal</b>, 
known as Yossi. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">I’m the son of Moshe <b>Goldstein</b>&nbsp; 
from Uzhgorod (Ungvar) and Chaya <b>Farkas</b> from Tjacev (Tecso). I’m also 
related through my grandmothers to the <b>Klein</b> family from Uzhgorod and the
<b>Aharon</b> family from Tjacev. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This is our first attempt to collect 
and record information about our families and ancestors. It is also our very 
first attempt to use the Internet to our purpose. We would like to use this 
technology to collect and to share the information among ourselves.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The idea is simple, we wanted to get to 
know our roots and past and specially to learn about those who did not survive 
the holocaust and WW2. This site will assist us with this effort. Still, there 
are many pieces missing: we did not get a chance to speak with most of the 
family members, we do not have access to formal records and therefore some of 
the information was assumed or been given to us by 3rd parties.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><u>The first phase</u> is simply to 
identify and record every member of the family with basic and key data about him 
and with at least one photo. Although we have a nice progress, still many 
members are missing, most of the persons here are without any information at all 
and others are still without a single photo.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><u>The second phase</u> really is to 
tell the story of each of us and as stated earlier, we specially would like to 
focus on our ancestors who lived in Eastern Europe from the 19<sup>th</sup> 
century (and possibly earlier) till 1945, the end of WW2. (I urge each one of 
you to go and just visit the pages of our older generation. Some of their 
stories are inspiring and most of them really give you another perspective for 
life...) </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><u>The third phase</u> is to try and 
maybe to find further and deeper roots of the family. So far we have managed to 
identify 5 generation of the <b>Klein / Aharon families</b>, from about 1860 
till today, hence around <font color="#800080"><b>140 years !</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">It is, as you can imagine, beyond the 
capacity of one person to do all by himself. This is where you come to the 
picture and how can we easily use the Internet to our cause:&nbsp; Please go and 
visit your own page or any other page. Check the information, the spelling, the 
photos or any other data that is in it or missing, help us to complete the 
project by sending us your comments. You are most welcome to forward this site 
to any other of our family member, (but please do it consciously, thinking about 
our own privacy.) Send your comment, details, stories and photos to my email :&nbsp;
<b>
<a href="mailto:josephgal@myrealbox.com" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
josephgal@myrealbox.com</a> </b>and I'll include them in the site. Please also 
send me your own homepage, if you have one and your email address; It will be 
included in the distribution list for communication and newsletters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Although there is no dead-line here and 
it will be updated constantly, I would like to believe we can finish the vast 
majority of the tasks of phase one and to concentrate in phase 2 and 3, which is 
the ultimate goal of this project.</font></p>

<p><u><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">About This site</font></b></u></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This site was built with a software 
tool named&nbsp; <a href="http://www.genopro.com/" target="_top">GenoPro</a>. 
Generally it serves our purposes well enough, yet it also has its limitations 
and we must understand it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">For your convenient, there is a 
Navigation Manu on the left side of the screen as follows:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><a href="index.names.htm" target="contents">Name Index - Sorted alphabetically
by last name</a></font></li>
  <li>
<a href="index.names.htm#Family Index" target="contents">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Family Index - Sorted
alphabetically by father's last name</font></a></li>
  
  <li>
<a href="index.names.htm#Photo Index" target="contents">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Photo Index - Sorted
alphabetically by last name</font></a></li>
  <li>
<a href="index.names.htm#Family Photo Index" target="contents">
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Family Photo Index - Sorted
alphabetically by father's last name</font></a></li>


</ul>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Those indexes will stay on your screen 
all the time. Scroll down until you'll find the right person you are looking 
for. Clicking on the desire name will open the person's page with all his 
details and photos. The photos will appear in thumbnail size. Just click on the 
photo to see it in full size and then click back to return to the page again. 
You can continue your navigation from the person's page as well: All his/her 
relatives and family will appear in blue and underlined, meaning that you can 
click on this name and surf further without the need to go back to the 
navigation manue on the left.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u><font size="4"><b>Names and</b></font><b><font size="4"> 
Statistics </font></b></u></font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">So far we have managed 
to record <u>528 photos</u>,&nbsp; <u>323 individuals</u>&nbsp; (171 males and 
152 females). There are about <u>100 families</u> with around <u>50 family names.</u> 
Please note that I have used the official name whenever it was known to me. 
Otherwise, I have used the name as it sounds or written in Hebrew. Throughout 
the years, people localized their family names (See Klein-Klain-Clyne or Aharon-Aaron-Aron-Aharoni-Aroni) 
otherwise the number of names were probably less. Again, please write to me how 
exactly are you using your names. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><u><b><font size="4">Graphical Family Tree</font></b></u></font></p>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Many of you have asked me about a 
graphical presentation of our family tree. Due the huge size of the tree, it 
requires a zoom-in/zoom-out capability. Until we will find a better solution, 
you are kindly requested to download a free version of the tool I'm using to build this 
site, the GnoPro. For smooth navigation, please use <a href="http://www.genopro.com/internet/Screen.GenoPro.DownloadAndOpen.gif">this
configuration</a> and then please&nbsp; <a href="http://www.genopro.com/InstallGenoPro.exe">
install</a> it on your computer. To view the family tree click on
<a href="http://us.f1.yahoofs.com/users/f8149973/bc/family/familytree.gno?bcYHpM.AXv4DW7Q2">family tree</a>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Good Luck.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Looking forward to hear from you.
